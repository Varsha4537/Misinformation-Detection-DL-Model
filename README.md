# Misinformation-Detection-DL-Model
This repository contains the code and resources for a research project focused on fake news detection using a combination of text analytics, machine learning, and deep learning methods. 
The study applies various techniques such as TF-IDF, Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Detection, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, and an LSTM-based neural network for classification. The goal is to analyze the linguistic and semantic patterns in textual data and accurately classify news articles as fake or real.

## 📌 Features
Text preprocessing and vectorization using TF-IDF

Sentiment and emotion analysis to identify psychological and emotional cues

Topic modeling via LDA to extract underlying themes in the articles

LSTM neural network model for fake news classification

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC AUC

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python, Jupyter Notebooks

NLP: spaCy, NLTK, TextBlob

Modeling: scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras

Topic Modeling: Gensim

Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib
