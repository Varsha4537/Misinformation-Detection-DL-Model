# Misinformation-Detection-DL-Model
This repository contains the code and resources for a research project focused on fake news detection using a combination of text analytics, machine learning, and deep learning methods. 
The study applies various techniques such as TF-IDF, Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Detection, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, and an LSTM-based neural network for classification. The goal is to analyze the linguistic and semantic patterns in textual data and accurately classify news articles as fake or real.
